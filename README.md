<!--- Note: The following text is duplicated in the AboutUsPage.tsx file -->

## Sudokuru is an open-source project focused on developing a world-class, cross-platform Sudoku app. We aim to provide a delightful user experience while also contributing to the community by building a collection of reusable software modules. These modules are designed to be free, well-documented, modern, and interoperable, allowing the open source community to easily incorporate them into their own Sudoku-related projects.

### This frontend module is the primary user interface for Sudokuru, providing a cross-platform Sudoku experience built with React Native Web and TypeScript. It offers a clean, intuitive design with features such as:

- 🎮 Play Sudoku across 9 different difficulty levels generated by the Sudokuru Clearinghouse module
- 🎓 Learn how to play Sudoku with lessons from the basics all the way to advanced strategies
- 📊 Statistics to track your progress
- ⚙️ Sensible default settings for casual players with options to customize the playing experience for users with different playstyles
- 💡Custom strategy based hints from the Sudokuru npm library module
- 📅 _Upcoming_: drills which let you practice individual strategies also powered by the Sudokuru npm library module

# 🛠️ Local development

## ⚙️ General Setup:

1. Git clone this repository
2. Install Node.js `v19.5.0` or later
3. Install npm `9.3.1` or later
4. Run `npm i` in the root folder
5. [Install pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

6. Run `pre-commit install` to setup pre-commit hooks. Pre-commit hooks can be run manually with `npm run pre-commit`, but will always run before git commit and git push if setup correctly.

## 📲 Mobile Setup (not needed to run website):

1. Contact Thomas to get added to the Expo organization so that you can log in with your own email and password.
2. Download the expo app on your mobile device.
3. On your development device, e.g., laptop, login by running: `expo login` and fill out the parameters.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application Locally

1. Run `npm run start` from this repositories root folder
2. For iOS, scan the QR code with your camera app, for Android you will need to scan the code from within the Expo app.
3. For Web, hit the w key to start up the website at `localhost:8081`

</details>

## 🎭 Playwright E2E Tests

### ⚙️ Setup

2. Run `npm run playwright:init` to install playwright dependencies
3. Inside of e2e/web folder, create a `.env` file in for local development based on values in `.env.example`

### 🏃‍♂️ Running the Tests

- ⚠️ Make sure that the website is running locally (or change baseURL to match where you want to test)
- 💻 Run `npm run playwright:ui` to run tests using playwright ui
- ⌨️ Run `npm run playwright:test` to run tests using playwright cli
- 📋 Run `npm run playwright:report` to view playwright report

### 🔧 Setup to use a Single Puzzle for Debugging

- In the `sudokuru/app/Api/Puzzles.ts` file, the `startGame` function can be modified so that only a single game is used.
- Replace `returnGameOfDifficulty(difficulty)` with `returnGameOfDifficulty("dev")` and the dev puzzle will be retrieved.
- The `returnGameOfDifficulty` function can also be modified to return a desired puzzle. By default, it returns the first `novice` puzzle.

## 🛡️🐶 Run Snyk scans

The command to run a Snyk Open Source scan is `npm run snyk:opensource`

The command to run a Snyk code scan is `npm run snyk:code`

Existing issues in the main branch can be [viewed here](https://app.snyk.io/org/sudokuru)

## 📦 Analyzing Bundle size with Atlas

To see the dev bundle size, run `npm run start:atlas`

To see the production bundle size, run `npm run start:atlas:prod`

Note - I was not able to get the `--no-dev` flag working with android, but it works for web and ios.

Connect to expo with the desired device to see the bundle size and package ratios.

You will need to navigate to the following url: http://localhost:8081/\_expo/atlas

It is possible to switch between multiple bundle types in the atlas UI for comparison.

iOS Example:

Android Example:

# Tips for updating Expo version

1. Read through the Expo release blog post.
2. When updating dependencies, ensure that there are no nested `node_modules` folders - there should only be one `node_module` folder inside of root. Try running commands `npm dedupe` and `npm list <package_name>` to help debug issues, as a likely cause of multiple `node_modules` folders generating is multiple versions of the same package. 

# 🛣️ Roadmap

## Github Project Kanban Boards

We organize our future work using the [Frontend Github Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/Sudokuru/projects/4/views/1) which we currently have divided into the following columns. We also apply labels which are [documented here](https://github.com/Sudokuru/Frontend/labels) and work towards milestones [listed here](https://github.com/Sudokuru/Frontend/milestones).

### 💡 Backlog

This is the general bucket for everything that we are considering doing someday but does not fit into any of the following boards.

### ⚙️ In development

This is for all the tickets we are currently working. Requires an acceptance criteria to be added to the description at this stage.

### 🚢 Shipped

This is for all the cool things we have already accomplished!
