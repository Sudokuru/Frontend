        # Explanation for the --quiet flag (which silences warnings)
        # When eslint is ran in files that are on the eslint ignore list, a warning is generated.
        # This happens because pre-commit runs these pre-commit hooks on all staged files.
        # There is an option eslint provides --no-warn-ignored which silences these warnings.
        # However, https://github.com/eslint/eslint/discussions/18019 it is only avalible for v9+ and not v8 which we are using.
        # Expo is in the process of supporting v9 https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/28144#issuecomment-
        # In our pipeline we can run without --quiet flag since it is not running on staged files.
